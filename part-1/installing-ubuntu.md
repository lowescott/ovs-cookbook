# Recipe 1.2: Installing OVS on Ubuntu

## Problem

You'd like to install OVS on a system running an LTS (Long-Term Support) release of Ubuntu.

## Solution

Depending on your version of Ubuntu, you can install OVS using `apt-get` (for older versions) or `apt` (for newer versions). Packages for OVS are included in the default repositories for 14.04 and 16.04, although these packages can be out of date in comparison to the latest releases of OVS. More up-to-date packages are often available from the Ubuntu Cloud Archive. This recipe shows you how to install OVS using the more up-to-date packages from the Ubuntu Cloud Archive.

## Details

The specifics of how to install OVS on Ubuntu will vary based on the Ubuntu release. The details for each major LTS release are included in separate sections below.

### 12.04 (Precise Pangolin)



### 14.04 (Trusty Tahr)



### 16.04 (Xenial Xerus)
