# Recipe 1.1: Compiling OVS from Master

## Problem

You'd like to install OVS on your Linux system, but your particular Linux distribution doesn't offer OVS packages or the OVS packages are too old. Alternately, you want or need to install the very latest version of OVS in order to test new features or functionality.

## Solution

In situations like these, the best approach is to compile OVS straight from the Git repository's master branch (hence, "compiling from master"). This is especially true when you need to test the very latest features and functionality. In cases where your Linux distribution doesn't offer packages, you may still need to compile from source, but you can use an older, more stable branch instead of the master branch.
