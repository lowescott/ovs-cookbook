# Configuring VLAN Trunking on Uplinks

## Problem

By default, OVS uplinks are always VLAN trunks (that is, they pass VLAN tags up to the bridge). However, there may be times when you need to configure the behavior of the VLAN trunking on the uplinks, such as setting the native (untagged) VLAN or limiting the VLANs that are trunked into OVS.
